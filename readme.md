# QSYNC_GO

## /!\ this software is not finished and comport many bugs that may lead to unexpected behaviors !
## qysync_go is a two ways folders synchronisation software entirely written in go and inspired by my last attempt in python ( very messy )

### this version is better for three main reasons :

    - faster as golang is faster than python
    - can be compiled and run on any OS
    - the process used to sync folders is way more reliable and simple


### How it works ?

    - too lazy to explain today.
